# Uffizzi-demo

Uffuzzi is a new cloud platform that helps developers deploy and host applications with no cloud infrastructure knowlege. Uffuzzi is similar to Heroku in many ways, but it is built on top of GKE which means that it has a very solid and scalable foundation. Let's deploy a simple python web application to Uffuzzi.
